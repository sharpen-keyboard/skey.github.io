# Love Letter Hover
 This is a simple HTML and CSS project that creates a digital card with a romantic message. The HTML file defines the structure of the card using a container, an envelope, a card with a message, a cover, a lid, a heart, and a shadow. The CSS file styles each element using custom properties, positioning, animation, and borders to create a realistic and responsive design. The project uses Google fonts for the headings and a color palette inspired by pink and red hues. You can use this code as a starting point to create your own digital cards or modify it to fit your needs.
